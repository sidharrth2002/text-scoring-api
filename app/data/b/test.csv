Individual directors are committed in serving the Company. The Board and Board Committees had been effective in carrying out their functions and duties. All independent directors had been and remain independent from management and free from any business relationship that could materially interfere with their independent judgement. The Board will consider engaging a professional, experienced and independent party to lend greater objectivity to the assessments as and when required. The above annual evaluation system is being reviewed to ensure they remain relevant in light of the new Companies Act 2016 and MCCG, and amendments to the Main Market Listing Requirements at the end of 2017. The Board is satisfied with the level of time commitment given by all the Directors towards fulfilling their roles and responsibilities as Directors of the Company.

The Directors are also required to submit a timely update on their other relevant directorships and shareholdings to the Company Secretaries, who will update the Board.

All assessment and evaluations carried out by the NRC in discharging its duties are documented in the minutes of meetings. Overall, NRC was satisfied with the composition of the Board and performance of the Board that all the Directors had met the criteria in terms of their capacity, integrity and commitment towards the Group. All three Independent Directors also had fulfilled the criteria for Independent Director as defined under LR. Board Meetings The Board ordinarily meets at least four 4 times a year at quarterly intervals which had been scheduled well in advance before the end of the preceding ficial year to facilitate the Directors in planning their meeting schedule for the year. Additional meetings are convened when urgent and important decisions need to be made between the scheduled meetings. The Board also met on an ad-hoc basis to deliberate urgent issues and matters that required expeditious Board direction or approval. In the intervals between Board Meetings, any matters requiring urgent Board decisions and/or approval were sought via circular resolutions which were supported with all the relevant information and explanations required for an informed decision to be made. Time Commitment As stipulated in the Board Charter, the Directors are required to devote sufficient time and efforts to carry out their responsibilities. The Board obtains this commitment from Directors at the time of their appointment. Each Director is expected to commit time as and when required to discharge the relevant duties and responsibilities, besides attending meetings of the Board and Board Committees. Notwithstanding that no specific quantum of time has been fixed, all the Board members are required to notify the Board before accepting any new directorship. Any Director is, while holding office, at liberty to accept Board appointment in other companies so long as the appointment is not in conflict with the Company's business and does not affect the discharge of his/her duty as a Director of the Company. To ensure the Directors have the time to focus and fulfill their roles and responsibilities effectively, one 1 criterion as agreed by the Board is that they must not hold directorships at more than five public listed companies as prescribed in Paragraph 15.06 of Listing Requirements . During the ficial year under review, none of the Directors have more than five 5 directorships in listed issuers listed on Bursa Securities. Besides, Board members are expected to achieve at least fifty percent 50 attendance of total Board Meetings in any applicable ficial year. Any leave of absence is to be notified to the Chairman and/or Company Secretaries, where applicable. The Board is satisfied with the level of time commitment given by the Directors towards fulfilling their roles and responsibilities as Directors of the Company. This is evidenced by the attendance record of the Directors at Board during the ficial year under review. Directors' Training The Board oversees the training needs of its Directors whereby Directors are regularly updated on the Group's businesses and the competitive and regulatory environment in which they operate. Although the Board does not have a policy requiring each Director to attend a specific number and types of training sessions each year, to keep abreast of industry developments and trends, the Directors are encouraged to attend various external professional programmes deemed necessary to ensure that they are kept abreast on various issues facing the changing business environment within which the Group operates, in order to fulfill their duties as Directors. Any Director so appointed to the Board is required to complete the Mandatory Accreditation Programme MAP within four months from the date of appointment. All Directors have attended and successfully completed the MAP within the time frame. In addition, the Company Secretaries usually circulates the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements from time to time for the Board's reference and briefs the Board on the updates, where applicable. External Auditors also brief the Board members on any changes to the Malaysian Ficial Reporting Standards that affect the Group's ficial statements for the ficial year under review. The Board will on a continuing basis evaluate and determine the training needs of each Director, particularly on relevant new laws and regulations and essential practices for effective corporate goverce and risk management to enable the Directors to effectively discharge their duties.

For Individual Directors, the criteria used in the assessment include contribution and performance, calibre and personality, industry experience, quality of input, understanding of roles, commitment, Directors' skill sets and Director's training needs. The criteria for assessing the independence of an Independent Director include the relationship between the Independent Director and the Group and the Independent Director's involvement in Board and/or Committee deliberations and any significant transaction with the Group. The results of the Board Effectiveness Evaluation were tabled to the NRSC. The key strengths identified from the Board Effectiveness Evaluation are as follows: . Board skill sets The Board is constituted of members who bring hard-edged skills and vast experience from multiple facets including property development, construction, valuation, architecture, business management, accounting and legal. The presence of high-calibre Directors with complementary skill sets has enriched the deliberation process and allowed the Board to make informed decision. Appointments to the Board are made via a formal process that is premised on meritocracy and takes into account the skills and experience needed in the context of the Company's objectives. . Board cohesion dynamics The Board functions as a collegial unit with the boardroom setting being characterised by professionalism, respect and candour. The Chairman encourages healthy deliberations and dissenting views are freely expressed. . Board commitment and productivity Board members are committed and invested in the affairs of the Company. This is largely inspired by passion for the business and a participative boardroom environment, . Efficacy of the Group Audit Committee The deliberations of the Audit Committee are robust, with members applying a critical and probing view of the Company's financial transactions and internal controls. The Audit Committee Chairman is recognised for his leadership qualities and ability to draw on the expertise and perspectives of the members. Based on the findings in the Board Effectiveness Evaluation, the areas of improvement recommended, amongst others, are as follows: . Board composition The Board is relatively large in size which may result in attendance challenges. The Board should review its Board's composition in order to have a critical mass in terms of Independent Directors which would enable them to rally for support, encourage and drive each other in the value creation of the business. . Strategic planning There are cogent indications that the Board should devote more focus on its value creation role with strategy taking centre-stage. There should also be heightened focus on matters involving market disruptions.",4,Applied,659, nrsc responsible conduct annual performance evaluation board board committees individual director annual evaluation include assessment independence independent directors board formalise directors assessment policy set procedure criterion use assessment board board committees individual director independence independent directors key objective board evaluation ensure board function evaluation serve reference point board evaluate balanced diversed skilled board wide range area expertise consistently maintain line practice mccg company march 2018 engage independent consultant boardroom corporate services kl sdn bhd boardroom collaboration kpmg management risk consulting sdn bhd kpmg facilitate objective professional candid board evaluation period april 2017 31 march 2018 board effectiveness evaluation carry base combination self peer assessment board member customise questionnaire premise qualitative quantitative criterion assessment criterion benchmarke good governance practice prescribe regulator good practice private interview director conduct boardroom collaboration kpmg corroborate assessment finding assessment board committees base specific criterion cover board mix composition quality information decision making strategy leadership boardroom activity board chairman role board skill set individual directors criterion use assessment include contribution performance calibre personality industry experience quality input understanding role commitment directors skill set director training need criterion assess independence independent director include relationship independent director group independent director involvement board committee deliberation significant transaction group result board effectiveness evaluation table nrsc key strength identify board effectiveness evaluation follow board skill set board constitute member bring hard edge skill vast experience multiple facet include property development construction valuation architecture business management accounting legal presence high calibre director complementary skill set enrich deliberation process allow board make informed decision appointment board make formal process premise meritocracy account skill experience need context company objective board cohesion dynamic board function collegial unit boardroom set characterise professionalism respect candour chairman encourage healthy deliberation dissent view freely express board commitment productivity board member commit invest affair company largely inspire passion business participative boardroom environment efficacy group audit committee deliberation audit committee robust member apply critical probe view company financial transaction internal control audit committee chairman recognise leadership quality ability draw expertise perspective member base finding board effectiveness evaluation area improvement recommend follow board composition board relatively large size result attendance challenge board review board composition order critical mass term independent directors enable rally support encourage drive value creation business strategic planning cogent indication board devote focus value creation role strategy centre stage heighten focus matter involve market disruption,46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,659,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0
